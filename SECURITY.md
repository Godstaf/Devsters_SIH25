# Security Best Practices for Devsters SIH25 (FastAPI + React)

## Authentication and Authorization
- Prefer OAuth2.1 with JWT bearer tokens for API auth. Scope endpoints under `/api` and require auth where applicable.
- Current implementation exposes a form login at `POST /loginit` that uses SHA-256 password hashing and sets `httponly` cookies for `userEmail` and `userName`. This is NOT a session and is insufficient for auth. Replace with:
  - Proper user table with salted password hashes using `bcrypt` or `argon2`.
  - Token-based auth (JWT) issued on login; store token in memory or secure cookie with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`.
  - Implement logout by invalidating tokens (short TTL + rotation/blacklist if needed).
- Enforce authorization checks on protected routes; least-privilege role-based access.

## Data Protection
- Validate and constrain all inputs with Pydantic schemas; reject unexpected fields.
- Database access uses parameterized queries via `psycopg2` â€” continue to avoid string interpolation to prevent SQL injection.
- Encode/escape user-provided content rendered in templates or returned to the SPA to mitigate XSS.
- Always deploy behind HTTPS in production; terminate TLS at a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Caddy) and forward to Uvicorn.
- Do not log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, full PII). Redact on logs/metrics.
- Configure CORS to only allow trusted origins for the SPA.
- If using cookies for auth, add CSRF protection on state-changing endpoints (double-submit or token per form) and set cookie flags: `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`.

## Dependency Management
- Keep backend dependencies in `requirements.txt` and update regularly. Run `pip-audit` in CI.
- For the frontend, run `npm audit`, use `npm audit fix --force` cautiously, and consider Snyk or Dependabot for both ecosystems.

## Secrets and Configuration
- Docker Compose sets DB env vars. For production, use Docker secrets or a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager) instead of plain env vars.
- Never commit secrets. Keep a `.env` (local only) out of VCS via `.gitignore`.
- Rotate credentials periodically. Use distinct credentials per environment.

## Logging and Monitoring
- Centralize structured logs; include request IDs and minimal PII.
- Enable access/error logs at the reverse proxy. Consider rate and anomaly detection on login endpoints.
- Add metrics (latency, error rates) and alerts. Consider tools like Prometheus/Grafana, ELK, or OpenTelemetry.

## Regular Security Audits
- Run automated security scans (dependency, container image, IaC). Suggested tools: `pip-audit`, `npm audit`, Trivy, Snyk.
- Conduct periodic penetration tests and threat modeling. Review code for security issues pre-release.

## Network, Containers, and Infrastructure
- Database is exposed on host port `5433` mapped to container `5432`. Limit exposure to local network in production; prefer private networks and security groups.
- The runtime container in `Dockerfile` runs as non-root (`appuser`). Keep it that way; avoid mounting unnecessary volumes in production.
- Keep images minimal and updated. Scan images (Trivy) and pin base images.
- Expose only required ports (backend `8000`). Place a reverse proxy in front with HTTPS, HSTS, and request size limits.

## Application Hardening Checklist
- Enforce CORS for known origins only.
- Add security headers via Starlette middleware: CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy.
- Implement rate limiting on login and sensitive endpoints (e.g., `slowapi` or proxy-level limits).
- Strong password policy and breach-check (k-Anonymity/HaveIBeenPwned).
- Account lockout/backoff on repeated failed logins.
- Short-lived tokens with refresh; rotate and revoke on logout.
- Comprehensive input validation and consistent error handling without leaking internals.
