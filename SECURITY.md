## Logging and Monitoring
- Implement logging to monitor access and errors.
- Use monitoring tools to detect unusual activity.

## Regular Security Audits
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
- Review code for security vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Conclusion
Following these best practices will help secure your FastAPI application and protect user data.
